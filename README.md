# Welcome to TriTracker!

I am building an application to help you track your triathlon training progress. I am building with Next.js,
Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and the Strava API.

The app will allow you to view triathlon activities you've uploaded to Strava and track your training progress.

Updates TBA.
